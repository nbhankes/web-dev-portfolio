Welcome to this repository. You can see it live at www.nbhankes.dev

I built this website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It's not that I don't like React, I do, but I decided I didn't need it for this project.

If you are interested in my ability to, um, well, React, check out my [dimensional analysis app](https://github.com/nbhankes/gatsby-chem-app_client_only).
